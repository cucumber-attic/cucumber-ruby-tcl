## Running tests

    gem install bundler
    bundle install
    bundle exec rake

This runs tests on both the Ruby and Tcl code.

## Release Process

* Bump the version number in `lib/cucumber/tcl/version`.

Now release it

    bundle update && bundle exec rake # check all tests are passing
    git commit -m "Release `cat lib/cucumber/tcl/version`"
    rake release
